# Example Summary


This demo code demonstrates the implementation of the RFID sensor TRF7907A with the MSP432P401R launchpad to detect Type 2 NFC tags and Type 5 NFC tags. 


# Example Usage

Once the RFID sensor is connected to the MSP432P401R launchpad using the correct pinouts from config.h, the RFID should be able to detect Type 2 NFC tags and Type 5 NFC tags. Type 2 will light up the red LED of the launchpad and Type 5 will light up the green LED of the launchpad.
